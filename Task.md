# Computer Science
Start date: 3/24
1. Daily coding problem. After finishing **Programming Skills I**, we will move on to a different set at the appropriate level.
2. Weekly reading from [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](http://xpzhang.me/teach/DS19_Fall/book.pdf) by Michael Goodrich. Assignments for the first 4 weeks are listed below.

## First steps
You can use Github Desktop to do the setup. I'll show you how to use git with VS code to speed up the upload process.
1. Create github repository called computer-science (optional: send me an invite). The full repository will be at: https://github.com/RL419/computer-science.   
- The README.md file can just say something like "Computer Science with my brother Ryan."  
- Github automatically tracks your tasks, so we don't have to manually check off your daily task.  

2. Create a folder called **Programming skills I**.  

3. Go to [Leetcode Study Plans](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/) and choose programming skills I and start.  

## Daily coding problem
The steps below will take one or two days to get used to, but after that you will be super fast.

1. Create a file called **test_question_name.py**.
2. Create a file called **question_name.py**.
3. Put the example test cases in the header of.
4. Write some notes in the file including thinking process, planning out the algorithm, and edge cases that you need to deal with.
5. Go to the **test_question_name.py** and write a unittest function. A unit test requires you to provide an input and supposed output, call the function on the input, then compare the function output vs. supposed output. I will give you an example (**Remember to ask me tomorrow otherwise I will definitely forget**). The unit test should cover regular and edge cases, repeating cases, and random cases.
6. Back to **question_name.py**. Write your algorithm and finish the function.
7. In the function, write the time and space complexity of your function. i.e. How long would it take if you put in N elements? How much storage is required?
8. Run your unittest on the function and see if it passes all test cases. If it does not, go back to step 6.
9. Paste your code in the leetcode editor and submit it. If it passes, hooray! If not, go back to step 5, add the failed test case, and add other edge or corner cases that you might be missing.
10. Git commit -- upload the folder to github.
11. [Optional after the first few days] On the first few days, wechat me after you finish.

## Weekly Reading
1. Pages 1-22: Begin the Python primer up to loops.
2. Pages 22-38: Up to try and except statements.
3. Pages 39-50: End of chapter 1.
4. Complete (any) 2 problems from Reinforcement, 2 problems from Creativity, and 3 problems from Projects.
